          <p>
            Opium is a record label founded in Atlanta, Georgia, own by rapper
            <span id="carti"> Playboi Carti(King Vamp)</span>. This label has
            many rappers such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Destroy Lonely</li>
            <li>Ken Carson</li>
            <li>Homixide Gang (Homicide Beno! & Homixide Meechie)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="no-center">Style of music</h2>
          <p>
            Musically, the Opium collective share a similar sound, with dark,
            gritty, and avant-garde synths mixed into a rage beat reminiscent of
            the '70s and '80s punk rock era. This experimental sound strays away
            from the current trap hip hop genre and has garnered its own
            cultlike fanbase <br /><br />Each artist embodies the Opium sound in
            the way they dress and present themselves, through both their street
            style and music videos. Artists don the style by appealing to
            all-black, heavy metal, punk, eccentric, non-conformist, horror, and
            vampire-esque aesthetics combined with anime imagery and fonts.

          <h2>The Opium look</h2>
          <p>
            Dressing in the Opium style allows emulation of rockstars to portray
            an unapologetic sense of rebellion and individuality. In a world
            where conformity is often encouraged, our generation craves a sense
            of uniqueness and self-expression, and Playboi Carti’s movement
            gives us a medium to do so in a distinct way.

          <h3 class="center">Influence On The Fashion</h3>
          <p>
            All the way from gothic fashion. Raider Klan already showed
            themselves in this style, but it was only from 2011 that the
            aesthetics became known to a wider public. Artists like A$AP Rocky
            and Playboi Carti contributed by frequently mentioning and wearing
            Rick Owens in their songs.
