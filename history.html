          <h2>How it all started</h2>
          <p>
            In December 2020, the highly anticipated Whole Lotta Red, Carti’s
            third studio album, finally dropped on Christmas morning. The album
            was heavily aggressive, filled with loud 808s and homicidal lyrics.
            The album art was a nod to the popular rock band Slayer. Carti’s
            style had entirely changed from nonchalant, upbeat, and relaxed to
            murderous and extremely energetic. With 23 credited producers, Carti
            had no shortage of production quality and help. One producer,
            though, was able to captivate audiences and make a name for himself
            after the release. F1lthy, a Philly native, is the producer
            responsible for some of the most memorable (and streamed) songs on
            the project such as Rockstar Made, Stop Breathing, and On That Time.
            Adding on to the mound of production assistance Carti received,
            Whole Lotta Red was executively produced by Kanye West and included
            features from massive names like Future, Kid Cudi, and West himself.
            Surprisingly, the release induced mixed results among his audience,
            with some hailing the release as the best trap album of all time,
            while others hated the repetitive lyricism and “lackluster
            features”. Despite these claims, Carti and his label’s popularity
            skyrocketed through a massively successful tour, merchandise, and
            social media presence. In fact, it seemed that over time his
            audience had grown accustomed to his new energetic style.

          <h2>Forming The Label</h2>
          <p>
            In 2019, before Whole Lotta Red’s release, Carti signed an unknown
            Atlanta native, Ken Carson, and two years later, another Atlanta
            native, Destroy Lonely. These two artists have taken the rock-rap,
            aggressively toned “rage music” and elevated it further. Lone and
            Ken continued to place beat selection and energy at forefront of
            their style, supplementing deeper lyricism and themes. Since 2020,
            Carti is yet to drop any music and has stayed quiet, with only a
            rumored album and a clothing line. It is truly his label that has
            kept his name alive and well within the scene. Ken Carson dropped
            his breakout album and second studio release, Project X, which had
            decent underground success and hype. Ken’s energy and incredible
            production brought the young artist into the limelight and set his
            next album’s release up perfectly. After singles and teasers, Ken
            dropped his most recent project, X, on July 8th, 2022. This album
            significantly elevated his status in the scene, but beyond that, Ken
            showed the world just how much energy can be expressed with beat
            selection and production alone. The songs are noisy, with bass and
            808s booming, and when combined with his harsh lyricism, Ken creates
            a rageful and energetic album. X, and Ken himself, really blew up
            when a dance trend on TikTok was made out of his song, “Freestyle
            2”. This rise in popularity brought the label more hype and fans for
            its next release.

          <h2>Why Is The Label So Hyped</h2>
          <p>
            The absence of traditional marketing and the overall nonchalant
            approach towards the music's popularity granted Opium Records a
            distinct and esoteric essence. Carti, in his unassuming manner,
            guided the evolution of his own style and nurtured experimentation
            among his label's signees. This led to the creation of a tightly
            knit community of artists who shared a common vision. The stage is
            now set for Carti's highly anticipated fourth studio album, a
            testament to his artistic growth and influence. Opium Records, with
            its dark and grungy aesthetic, continues to expand, welcoming the
            possibility of new signees and exciting projects on the horizon. For
            those who have been following the label's journey, there is a sense
            of eager anticipation and a commitment to listening along through it
            all, as Opium Records continues to shape the course of music
            history.
